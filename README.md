# Overview

As I develop my software engineering skills one of the things I want to focus on is implementing different custom data structures and algorithms across several languages. This will help me make sure I have a sincere understanding of the different algorithms and how to implement them. The setup to create data structures to implement the algorithms on will also help me create a foundation in new languages as I work.

The hello_world.py program is just as simple as it sounds and just prints a 'Hello World!' message to the console.

This is a collection of small projects that I have done to familiarize myself with new programming languages and technologies.

# Development Environment

For the hello_world.py program I used python 3. For something this simple, there were no additional libraries needed.

# Useful Websites

On the hello_world.py program I did not need to look anything up on any websites.
